Rule Engine with AST

This project implements a rule engine capable of representing, combining, and evaluating conditional rules using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).

Features:

Rule parsing: Parses rule strings into ASTs.
Rule evaluation: Evaluates ASTs against data.
Rule management: Creates, combines, modifies, and stores rules.
Data storage: Stores rules in a JSON file (can be easily extended to use a database).
Usage:

Install required libraries: ast, json.
Run the main.py file.
Security:

Input validation: Validates rule strings and data to prevent injection attacks.
Access control: Implements appropriate access controls to restrict rule creation and modification to authorized users.
Data encryption: Encrypts sensitive data before storing it in the JSON file (or database).
Performance:

Rule optimization: Explores techniques like rule simplification and pruning to improve evaluation performance.
Rule caching: Caches evaluated rules for frequently used data to reduce redundant computations.
Data indexing: Indexes data fields used in rules for faster lookups.
Performance profiling: Uses profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize code.
Additional Considerations:

Error handling: Provides informative error messages for invalid rules or data.
Extensibility: Allows for customization and extension of the rule language and evaluation logic.
Testing: Includes comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
